  Abstract                 = {This study presents PKSolver, a freely available menu-driven add-in program for Microsoft
Excel written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), for solving basic problems in pharma-
cokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data analysis. The program provides a range of
modules for PK and PD analysis including noncompartmental analysis (NCA), compartmen-
tal analysis (CA), and pharmacodynamic modeling. Two special built-in modules, multiple
absorption sites (MAS) and enterohepatic circulation (EHC), were developed for fitting the
double-peak concentrationâ€“time profile based on the classical one-compartment model.
In addition, twenty frequently used pharmacokinetic functions were encoded as a macro
and can be directly accessed in an Excel spreadsheet. To evaluate the program, a detailed
comparison of modeling PK data using PKSolver and professional PK/PD software package
WinNonlin and Scientist was performed. The results showed that the parameters esti-
mated with PKSolver were satisfactory. In conclusion, the PKSolver simplified the PK and
PD data analysis process and its output could be generated in Microsoft Word in the form
of an integrated report. The program provides pharmacokinetic researchers with a fast and
easy-to-use tool for routine and basic PK and PD data analysis with a more user-friendly
interface.},
